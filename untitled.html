	<p>In 1665,a terrible sickness swept through England.It was called the plague.It
		caused huge swellings all over the body and made peoples skin turn black.There
		was no cure.Most people who caught it died a quick and painful death.Any place
		people lived crowded together was dangerous,because plague was very easy to 
		catch.No one knew what caused it,or how to protect themselves against it.The
		only way to stay safe was to go to the countryside,where there were fewer 
		people to catch it from.A twenty-three-year-old student named Isaac Newton
		had to leave Cambridge University and flee to his mother's farmhouse.He didn't
		really mind.He always been a loner.He didn't have friends he would miss.At his
		mother's house,he spent the time doing what he did best--thinking about the
		universe.One day he saw an apple fall.He began to wonder what pulled the apple
		toward the Earth.And so,according to the famous legend(which might even be true),
		yound Issac Newton thought up the idea of gravity.The plague years were a terrible
        time for most people,but not for Newton.For him,they were a wonderful time of 
        discovery,and not just about gravity.He came up with enough new ideas to 
        keep him busy thinking and writing for the rest of his life.His ideas helped
        people understand how the universe worked in a new way.After eighteen months,
        Newton went back to Cambridge,but he never did make many friends. He was jealous
        and unfriendly,and lost his temper easily.He wasn't a very nice person,but he was one
        of the greatest scientific geniuses who ever lived.
